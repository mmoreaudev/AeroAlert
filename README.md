**# 🌤️ AeroAlert

**AeroAlert** is a lightweight, reusable, and cost-effective meteorological probe system designed to study **meteorological epiphenomena** using miniaturized sensors deployed via rockets. Our goal is to improve understanding and forecasting of high-risk weather events by collecting simultaneous atmospheric data across multiple points within a small geographical area.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The AeroAlert system works as follows:

1. **Launch**: A compact rocket is launched into the atmosphere.
2. **Deployment**: Upon reaching maximum altitude, a parachute is deployed.
3. **Data Collection**: While descending, the onboard sensors collect meteorological data.
4. **Storage & Visualization**: Collected data is stored and later visualized using a dedicated Human-Machine Interface (HMI).

## 🎯 Purpose

The core objective of AeroAlert is to **study meteorological epiphenomena**—those rare or secondary weather-related events that are often difficult to capture using conventional equipment. By deploying multiple inexpensive probes simultaneously across a small region, we can:

- Collect high-resolution atmospheric data
- Analyze localized phenomena
- Improve early detection and forecasting of extreme weather conditions

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- 🛰️ **Embedded sensors** for atmospheric data (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure)
- 💻 **Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)** for data acquisition and storage
- 🪂 **Mechanical parachute deployment system**
- 📈 **HMI (Human-Machine Interface)** for data visualization
- 🚀 **Model rocket system** for deployment
- 🔋 **Battery-powered modules** for portability and reusability

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

> *Note: Hardware setup and code repository coming soon*

### Prerequisites

- Microcontroller development environment (e.g., MICROCHIP)
- Sensor modules (temperature, pressure, humidity, etc.)
- Model rocket and deployment hardware
- Local or web-based interface for HMI

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aeroalert.git
cd aeroalert
```

## 📊 Data & Visualization
All collected meteorological data (such as temperature, pressure, and humidity at various altitudes) is stored in onboard memory and can be exported in CSV/JSON format. The HMI displays this data through:

- Interactive graphs 📉
- Real-time metrics 📡
- Historical logs 🗂️
- ♻️ Reusability & Portability

## AeroAlert is designed with:

- 🔋 Long battery life
- 🪶 Lightweight components
- 🔄 Modular structure for easy reconfiguration and redeployment
